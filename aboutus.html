      <h1>About the organisation</h1>

      Innerva Virtual Inc is built off of years of research in long-term care settings, endeavoring to understand how to
      create 21st century solutions for the aging population as everyday care becomes more important while the
      population ages. Virtual reality offers many opportunities to improve health in terms of cognitive, emotional and
      even physical wellbeing and is a growing approach to research and study across the world. Innerva Virtual Inc's
      mission is to drive development in software so as to provide powerful new tools to seniors, caregivers, clinicians
      and researchers.


      <h1>Problem we are solving</h1>

      There is a dearth of resources and gaps in care in the aging care industry. Too many aging seniors living at home
      and in care centers feel isolated, alone, disengaged, and far from specialist resources (such as PT/OT) unless in
      an urgent care situation. They also happen to have been more or less left out of the third industrial revolution
      culturally. This needs to be addressed. We build VR with seniors in mind. Standardized assessment tests for
      gait/balance as well as cognitive tests that measure memory/attention. Rehabilitative exercises and routines are
      taught in VR space, engaging the user and teaching as they go along. While they do this the IVI VR platform also
      records Headset+body motion in 3d space, capturing a snapshot of the user during the activity that can be reviewed
      remotely, and at another time by a caregiver. The platform is meant to provide multiple vectors of health and
      wellness that the user may engage in, and capture longitudinal data that could lead to preventative measures and
      avoid falls/fractures or the development of other serious conditions.
